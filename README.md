# Gold Prices and Geopolitical Risk Analysis
## Project Overview

This project examines the relationship between geopolitical risk and gold prices using daily data. Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset, often attracting capital during periods of heightened political uncertainty. The objective of this study is to empirically test whether increases in geopolitical risk are associated with statistically significant movements in gold returns.

The analysis integrates daily gold spot prices with the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) Index to evaluate correlation strength, lag effects, and volatility behavior during high-risk periods.

## Research Objectives

Determine whether geopolitical risk significantly influences gold returns

Quantify the strength and direction of the relationship using statistical modeling

Evaluate lag effects to identify delayed market reactions

Assess gold’s volatility behavior during periods of elevated geopolitical stress

Test whether gold behaves as a true safe-haven asset

Data Sources

Daily Gold Spot Prices

Daily Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR)

Both datasets were synchronized on a common datetime index to ensure proper alignment for time-series analysis.
